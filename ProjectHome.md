# MySvn #

## Features ##
  * Create and remove Subversion repositories
  * Auto creation of a trac project with repository
  * No seperate login for svn, trac and webapp itself
  * Control svn/trac permissions

## Why ##
While there are couple of projects that do mostly or exactly the same thing, they are A. written in python, like submin, and i haven't had the time to dive into that language or B. the project is a bit outdated, like svnadmin, and looking at the code base it is not something i would like to continue working on.

Some why the hell PHP?
I most familiar with php. I know php isn't the most beautiful engineered language but it does the trick for me. I'm using the lightweight CodeIgniter framework to build the application. Isn't that a bit overkill? Well, maybe, but it gives me lots of functionality i can use for building the application. Only the classes I need get loaded.

This is the initial basic layout, more to come when features are added.
